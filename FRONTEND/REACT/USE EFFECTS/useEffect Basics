useEffect is a hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in function components.There is no need for urban dictionary - basically any work outside of the component. Some examples of side effects are: subscriptions, fetching data, directly updating the DOM, event listeners, timers, etc.

useEffect hook
accepts two arguments (second optional)
first argument - cb function
second argument - dependency array
by default runs on each render (initial and re-render)
cb can't return promise (so can't make it async)
if dependency array empty [] runs only on initial render
